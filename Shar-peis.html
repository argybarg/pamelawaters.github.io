                                    The Shar-Pei is a breed of dog known for its deep wrinkles and blue-black tongue. The breed originates from Canton, China. The English name (沙皮, pinyin: shā pí) is probably derived from the British spelling of the Cantonese equivalent, sā pèih, which translates to "sand skin" and refers to the texture of its short, rough coat. As puppies, Shar Pei have numerous wrinkles, but as they mature, these loosen and spread out as they "grow into their skin." Shar Pei were named in 1978 as one of the world's rarest dog breeds by TIME magazine and the Guinness World Records. Although the Shar Pei has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century, the American Kennel Club recognized it as their 134th breed only in 1992.
